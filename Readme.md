# Babel-React App Template

Welcome to the Babel-React App Template repository! This repository provides a foundational setup for developing a React application with Babel, offering two distinct branches for your development preferences: a function-based approach and a class-based approach.

## Features:

- **Function-Based Branch**: Utilizes React's functional components and hooks.
- **Class-Based Branch**: Uses React's class components and lifecycle methods.
- Babel setup for modern JavaScript transpilation.
- Essential dependencies to kickstart your React application.

## Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/babel-react-template.git
    ```

2. **Switch to the desired branch**:
   - For function-based setup:
     ```bash
     git checkout function-based
     ```
   - For class-based setup:
     ```bash
     git checkout class-based
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Why Two Branches?

The React community is split between two predominant ways of writing components: functional and class-based. While functional components with hooks have become more popular due to their simplicity and power, class-based components are still widely used, especially in legacy projects. This template offers both setups so developers can choose based on their comfort level or project requirements.
